# SAR-CLIP-SAR-CoCa-SAR-GPT-and-SAR-TEXT
This is the official repository of the paper "SAR-TEXT: A Large-Scale SAR Image-Text Dataset Built with SAR-Narrator and Progressive Transfer Learning".

This project aims to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and semantic understanding using vision-language models. We build a large-scale SAR-Text dataset, design an automatic captioning framework (SAR-Narrator), and develop tailored models for key vision-language tasks. Everything—including code, models, and data—will be open-sourced to support the community.

The following items will be completed before August 1, 2025 (Beijing Time):

1.Models and training code.

2.SAR-TEXT Datasets.

3.Additional relevant information and data.
